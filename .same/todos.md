# MBS Website Project Todos

## Completed ✅
- ✅ Fixed admin dashboard client-side exception and white screen errors
- ✅ Updated Atlas shingles to display as individual product cards like CertainTeed
- ✅ Each Atlas color variant now shows as separate product with specs, install guides, and direct add to cart
- ✅ Added consistent product descriptions for all shingle products
- ✅ Removed color selection system for Atlas products for simpler user experience

## Current Status
- Atlas products now display with same layout as CertainTeed products
- Each Atlas shingle (ProLam, Pinnacle, StormMaster) shows in individual cards with:
  - Product name (e.g., "Black ProLam")
  - "3-Tab Architectural Shingle" description
  - Price per bundle (e.g., "$115.99 / Bundle")
  - Coverage specs (33.3 sq ft per bundle, 3 bundles per square, Limited Lifetime Warranty)
  - Specs and Install Guide buttons
  - Quantity selector and Add to Cart button

## Test Needed
- ✅ Verify Atlas products display correctly in inventory page
- ✅ Test that Atlas products have same functionality as CertainTeed (add to cart, quantity, specs)
- ✅ Confirm no color selection step for Atlas products

## Priority Items
- All main tasks completed successfully
- Website ready for production use
